https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#event_sourced_entity[Event Sourced Entities] persist changes as events and snapshots. Kalix needs to serialize that data to send it to the underlying data store. However, we recommend that you do not persist your service's public API messages. This may introduce some overhead to convert from one type to an internal one but allows the service public interface logic to evolve independently of the data storage format, which should be private.

The steps necessary to implement an Event Sourced Entity include:

. Model the entity's state and its domain events.
. Implementing behavior in command and event handlers.
. Creating and initializing the Entity.


The following sections walk through these steps using a shopping cart service as an example (working sample available {sample-url}[here {tab-icon}, window="new"]).

== Model the entity

Through our "Shopping Cart" Event Sourced Entity we expect to manage our cart, adding and removing items as we please. Being event-sourced means it will represent changes to state as a series of domain events. So let's have a look at what kind of model we expect to store and the events our entity might generate.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCart.java
----
include::example$spring-eventsourced-shopping-cart/src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCart.java[tag=domain]
----
<1> Our `ShoppingCart` is fairly simple, being composed only by a `cartId` and a list of line items.
<2> A `LineItem` represents a single product and the quantity we intend to buy.

NOTE: Above we are taking advantage of the Java `record` to reduce the amount of boilerplate code, but you can use regular classes so long as they can be serialized to JSON (e.g. using Jackson annotations).

Another fundamental aspect of our entity will be its domain events. For now, we will have 3 different events `ItemAdded`, `ItemRemoved` and `CheckedOut`, defined as below:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCartEvent.java
----
include::example$spring-eventsourced-shopping-cart/src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCartEvent.java[tag=events]
----
<1> Include logical type name as JSON property "type."
<2> Declare subtypes of the serializable polymorphic type `ShoppingCartEvent` associating logical names with each.
<3> The 3 types of event all derive from the same type `ShoppingCartEvent`.

IMPORTANT: The use of logical names for subtypes is essential for maintainability purposes. Since that information is persisted, failing to do so might lead to the use of a FQCN preventing the application from correctly deserialize the events in case of a package change.

== Implementing behavior

Now that we have our Entity state defined along with its events, the remaining steps can be summarized as follows:

- declare your entity and pick an entity key (it needs to be unique as it will be used for sharding purposes);
- define an access point (i.e. a route path) to your entity;
- implement how each command is handled and which event(s) it generates;
- provide a handler for each event and how it affects the entity's state.

Let's have a look at what our shopping cart entity will look like for the first 2 steps from the above list:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartEntity.java
----
include::example$spring-eventsourced-shopping-cart/src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartEntity.java[tag=class]
----
<1> Create a class that extends `EventSourcedEntity<S>`, where `S` is the state type this entity will store (i.e. `ShoppingCart`).
<2> Annotate such class with `@EntityKey`  and pass the name of the key that will be used as the
entity unique identifier.
<3> Make sure to annotate such class with `@EntityType` and pass a unique name for this entity type.
<4> Use Spring's RequestMapping annotation to define the route to your entity.


NOTE: The EntityKey `cartId` must match a path parameter (i.e. `cartId`) and such value needs to be unique per entity. On the other hand, the EntityType `shopping-cart` is common for all instances of this entity but must be stable - cannot be changed after a production deploy - and unique across the different entity types.

----
include::example$spring-eventsourced-shopping-cart/src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartEntity.java[tag=generateId]
----
<1> Annotate the command handler with `@GenerateEntityKey`.
<2> Access the generated id and reply.

=== Updating state

Having created the basis of our entity, we will now define how each command is handled. In the example below, we define a new endpoint that will add a new line item to a given shopping cart. It returns an `Effect` to emit an event and then sends a reply once the event is stored successfully. The state is updated by the event handler.

IMPORTANT: The **only** way for a command handler to modify the Entity's state is by emitting an event. Any modifications made directly to the state (or instance variables) from the command handler are not persisted. When the Entity is passivated and reloaded, those modifications will not be present.

.src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartEntity.java
----
include::example$spring-eventsourced-shopping-cart/src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartEntity.java[tag=addItem]
----
<1> The validation ensures the quantity of items added is greater than zero and it fails for calls with illegal values by returning an `Effect` with `effects().error`.
<2> From the current incoming `LineItem` we create a new `ItemAdded` event representing the change of the cart.
<3> We store the event by returning an `Effect` with `effects().emitEvent`.
<4> The acknowledgment that the command was successfully processed is only sent if the event was successfully stored and applied, otherwise there will be an error reply. The lambda parameter `newState` gives us access to the new state returned by applying such event.
<5> Event handler needs to be marked with `@EventHandler` and receive a single parameter type matching the event type produced (i.e. `ItemAdded`).
<6> Return the new state to be stored - the logic for state transition is defined inside the `ShoppingCart` domain model.


NOTE: There needs to be one event handler declared per each type of event the ES entity emits (e.g. `itemAdded` receives a parameter of type `ItemAdded`, the same type emitted in `addItem` command handler).

As mentioned above, the business logic that allows us to transition between states was placed on the domain model as seen below:

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCart.java
----
include::example$spring-eventsourced-shopping-cart/src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCart.java[tag=itemAdded]
----
<1> For an existing item, we will make sure to sum the existing quantity with the incoming one.
<2> Returns an update list of items without the existing item.
<3> Adds the update item to the shopping cart.
<4> Returns a new instance of the shopping cart with the updated line items.


=== Retrieving state

To have access to the current state of the entity we can use `currentState()` as you have probably noticed from the examples above. However, what if this is the first command we are receiving for this entity? The following example shows the implementation of the read-only command handler (accessed through `GET /cart/myCarId`):

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartEntity.java
----
include::example$spring-eventsourced-shopping-cart/src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartEntity.java[tag=getCart]
----
<1> Stores the `entityId` on an internal attribute so we can use it later.
<2> Provides initial state - overriding `emptyState()` is optional but if not doing it, be careful to deal with a currentState() with a `null` value when receiving the first command or event.
<3> Marks this method as a command handler for `GET` requests.
<4> Returns the current state as reply for the request.

IMPORTANT: For simplicity purposes, we are returning the internal state directly back to the requester. In a real-world scenario, it's usually better to instead convert this internal domain model into a public model so the internal representation is free to evolve without breaking clients code.

== Snapshots

include::java:partial$eventsourced-snapshots.adoc[]

== Testing the Entity

The following snippet shows how the `EventSourcedTestKit` is used to test the `ShoppingCartEntity` implementation. Kalix provides two main APIs for unit tests, the `EventSourcedTestKit` and the `EventSourcedResult`. The former gives us the overall state of the entity and all the events produced by all the calls to the Entity. While the latter only holds the effects produced for each individual call to the Entity.

.src/test/java/com/example/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCartTest.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$spring-eventsourced-shopping-cart/src/test/java/com/example/shoppingcart/domain/ShoppingCartTest.java[]
----
<1> Creates the TestKit passing the constructor of the Entity.
<2> Calls the method `addItem` from the Entity in the `EventSourcedTestKit` with quantity `10`.
<3> Asserts the return value is `"OK"`.
<4> Returns the next event of type `IdemAdded` and asserts on the quantity.
<5> Add a new item with quantity `5`.
<6> Asserts that the total number of events should be 2.
<7> Calls the `getCart` method and asserts that quantity should be `15`.


*EventSourcedResult*

Calling a command handler through the TestKit gives us back an link:{attachmentsdir}/testkit/kalix/javasdk/testkit/EventSourcedResult.html[`EventSourcedResult` {tab-icon}, window="new"]. This class has methods that we can use to assert the handling of the command, such as:

* `getReply()` - the response from the command handler if there was one, if not an, exception is thrown, failing the test.
* `getAllEvents()` - all the events emitted by handling the command.
* `getState()` - the state of the entity after applying any events the command handler emitted.
* `getNextEventOfType(ExpectedEvent.class)` - check the next of the emitted events against an event type, return it for inspection if it matches, or fail the test if it does not. The event gets consumed once is inspected and the next call will look for a subsequent event.

*EventSourcedTestKit*

For the above example, this class provides access to all the command handlers of the `ShoppingCart` entity for unit testing. In addition to that also has the following methods:

* `getState()` - the current state of the entity, it is updated on each method call emitting events.
* `getAllEvents()` - all events emitted since the creation of the testkit instance.
