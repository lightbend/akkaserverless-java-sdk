= Implementing Actions

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]
include::partial$actions.adoc[]

In this first example, you will learn how to implement an Action as a pure stateless function. You will create a `FibonacciAction` that takes a number and returns the
next number in the Fibonacci series.

== Implementing the Action

To implement this action you need the following:

- Extend our class from `kalix.javasdk.action.Action`. This is generic. No matter what action you want to create you always need to extend from link:{attachmentsdir}/testkit/kalix/javasdk/action/Action.html[`Action` {tab-icon}, window="new"].
- Add the Spring annotation @RequestMapping to provide a REST endpoint for the function. Here the stateless function should be reachable via HTTP.
- Add the Spring annotations @GetMapping and @PostMapping to provide paths for GET and POST to calculate the Fibonacci of a number. Both functions do the same thing and implementation-wise the function exposed with GET calls the function exposed with POST.

<1> `isFibonacci` checks if a number is a Fibonacci number
<2> `nextFib` calculates the next number.
<3> This `nextNumber` implementation calls the `nextNumber` implementation below.
<4> The `nextNumber` implementation first checks if the input number belongs to the Fibonacci series. If so, it calculates the
next number and builds a reply using `effects().reply()`.
<5> Otherwise, if the input number doesn't belong to the Fibonacci series, it builds an `Effect` reply error.

Actions return effects (i.e. `Action.Effect`) and there are different types of effects: a reply, an error, a forward call to another component, and to all of those you can add side effects. Here you want only the result of the calculation or an error. Therefore you are using `.reply` and `.error`.

=== Multiple replies / reply streaming

An Action may return a stream of integers. To do this you need to define the return type as `reactor.core.publisher.Flux<Effect<Integer>>`. 

The stream may publish an arbitrary number of replies.

== Testing the Action


=== Unit tests

The following snippet shows how the `ActionTestkit` is used to test the `FibonacciAction` implementation.

With the `ActionTestkit` you can call the methods of `FibonacciAction`. Each call you pass over to the test kit returns an `ActionResult` that contains the effect produced by the underlying action method.

NOTE: Actions are unique units of computation where no local state is shared with previous or subsequent calls. The framework does not reuse an `Action` instance but creates a new one for each command handled and therefore this is also how the test kit behaves.

Calling an action method through the test kit gives us back an link:{attachmentsdir}/testkit/kalix/javasdk/testkit/ActionResult.html[`ActionResult` {tab-icon}, window="new"]. This class has methods that you can use to assert your expectations, such as:
+
* `getReply()` returns the reply message passed to `effects().reply()` or throws an exception failing the test, if the effect returned was not a reply.
* `getError()` returns the error description when `effects().error()` was returned to signal an error.
* `getForward()` returns details about what message was forwarded and where the call was forwarded (since it is a unit test the forward is not actually executed).
