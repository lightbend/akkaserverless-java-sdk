= Implementing Value Entities

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]

https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#value_entity[Value Entities] persist state on every change and thus Kalix needs to serialize that data to send it to the underlying data store. However, we recommend that you do not persist your service's public API messages. This may introduce some overhead to convert from one type to an internal one but allows the service public interface logic to evolve independently of the data storage format, which should be private.

The steps necessary to implement a Value Entity include:

. Defining the API and model the entity's state.
. Implementing behavior in command handlers.
. Creating and initializing the Entity.

The following sections walk through these steps using a counter service as an example.

== Modeling the entity

As mentioned above, to help us illustrate a Value Entity, you will be implementing a Counter service. For such service, you will want to be able to set the initial counter value but also to increase the counter modifying its state. The state will be a simple `Integer` but you will use a wrapper class `Number` for our API, as shown below:

.src/main/java/com/example/Number.java
[source,java]

== Implementing behavior

Now that you have a good idea of what we want to build and what its API looks like, you will need to:

- Declare your entity and pick an entity key (it needs to be a unique identifier).
- Define an access point (i.e. a route path) to your entity.
- Implement how each command is handled.

Let us start by showing how to create the Value Entity:

.src/main/java/com/example/CounterEntity.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$spring-valueentity-counter/src/main/java/com/example/CounterEntity.java[tags=declarations]
----
<1> Every Entity must be annotated with `@EntityType` with a stable name. This name should be unique among the
different existing entities within a Kalix application.
<2> The `@EntityKey` value should be unique per entity and map to some field being received on the route path, in this example it's the `counter_id`.
<3> The `CounterEntity` class should extend `kalix.javasdk.valueentity.ValueEntity`.
<4> The initial state of each counter is defined as 0.

include::partial$generate-entity-keys.adoc[tag=intro]

.src/main/java/com/example/CounterEntity.java
[source,java]
----
include::example$spring-valueentity-counter/src/main/java/com/example/CounterEntity.java[tags=generateId]
----
<1> Annotate the command handler with `@GenerateEntityKey`.
<2> Access the generated id and reply.

include::partial$generate-entity-keys.adoc[tag=details]

=== Updating state

We will now show how to add the command handlers for supporting the two desired operations (`set` and `plusOne`). Command handlers are implemented as methods on the entity class but are also exposed for external interactions and always return an `Effect` of some type.

.src/main/java/com/example/CounterEntity.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$spring-valueentity-counter/src/main/java/com/example/CounterEntity.java[tags=behaviour]
----
<1> Expose the `set` command handler on path `/counter/\{counter_id\}/set` as a PUT endpoint where `counter_id` will be its unique identifier.
<2> Set the new counter value to the value received as body of the command request.
<3> Reply with the new counter value wrapped within a `Number` object.
<4> The method is accessible as a POST endpoint on `/counter/\{counter_id\}/plusone`, where `counter_id` will be its unique identifier.
<5> `plusOne` increases the counter by adding 1 to the current state.
<6> Finally, using the Effect API, you instruct Kalix to persist the new state, and build a reply with the wrapper object.

NOTE: The `counter_id` parameter matches the `entityKey` value. Also, for this example, we have opted to always repeat the common route `/counter/\{counter_id\}` for each command but a simpler option could be to use a `@RequestMethod("/counter/\{counter_id\}")` at class level.

[#deleting-state]
=== Deleting state

The next example shows how to delete a Value Entity state by returning special `deleteState()` effect.

NOTE: After deleting the Value Entity it is possible to create it again, with the same entity ID.

.src/main/java/com/example/CounterEntity.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$spring-valueentity-counter/src/main/java/com/example/CounterEntity.java[tags=delete]
----
<1> We delete the state by returning an `Effect` with `effects().deleteState()`.

=== Retrieving state

The following example shows how to implement a simple endpoint to retrieve the current state of the entity, in this case the value for a specific counter.

.src/main/java/com/example/CounterEntity.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$spring-valueentity-counter/src/main/java/com/example/CounterEntity.java[tags=query]
----
<1> Expose the `get` query handler on path `/counter/\{counter_id\}` as a GET endpoint where `counter_id` will be its unique identifier.
<2> Reply with the current state wrapped within a `Number`.

== Testing the Entity

include::partial$testing-entity.adoc[]


=== Unit tests

The following snippet shows how the `ValueEntityTestKit` is used to test the `CountertEntity` implementation. Kalix provides two main APIs for unit tests, the `ValueEntityTestKit` and the `ValueEntityResult`. The former gives us the overall state of the entity and the ability to call the command handlers while the latter only holds the effects produced for each individual call to the Entity.

./src/test/java/com/example/CounterTest.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$spring-valueentity-counter/src/test/java/com/example/CounterTest.java[tags=example]
----
<1> Creates the TestKit passing the constructor of the Entity.
<2> Calls the method `set` from the Entity in the `ValueEntityTestKit` with value `10`.
<3> Asserts the reply value is `10`.
<4> Calls the method `plusOne` from the Entity in the `ValueEntityTestKit` and assert reply value of `11`.
<5> Asserts the state value after both operations is `11`.

=== Integration tests

The skeleton of an Integration Test is generated for you if you use the archetype to start you Kalix app. Let's see what it could look like to test our Counter Entity:

./src/it/java/com/example/CounterIntegrationTest.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::example$spring-valueentity-counter/src/it/java/com/example/CounterIntegrationTest.java[tags=sample-it]
----
<1> Note the test class must extend `KalixIntegrationTestKitSupport`.
<2> A built-in web-client is provided to interact with the components.
<3> Request to get the current value of the counter named `bar`. Initial value of counter is expected to be `0`.
<4> Request to increase the value of counter `bar`. Response should have value `1`.
<5> Explicit `GET` request to retrieve value of `bar` that should be `1`.

NOTE: The integration tests are under in a specific project profile `it` and can be run using `mvn verify -Pit`.
