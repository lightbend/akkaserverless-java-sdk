= Developing with Spring (beta)

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]
include::partial$attributes.adoc[]

The Spring SDK provides a code-first approach to developing Kalix applications so that a developer does not need to worry about learning protobuf upfront.

This SDK offers a way to develop applications which should be familiar to someone who has worked with Spring applications by making use of annotations to assemble Kalix and its components.

When using the Kalix Spring SDK, your services are exposed using traditional Spring REST annotations and serialization is backed by the ubiquitous Jackson library. 

NOTE: If you're new to Kalix and the different types of entities that exist in a Kalix app, consider reading https://docs.kalix.io/services/programming-model.html#_what_is_a_kalix_service[this section] before continuing.

== Prerequisites

The following are required to develop services in Java:

Java:: Kalix requires Java {spring-java-version} or later.

Apache Maven:: Kalix relies on https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven {tab-icon}, window="new"] as build tool. 

Docker:: Kalix requires https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker {tab-icon}, window="new"] {minimum_docker_version} for building your service images. Most popular build tools have plugins that assist in building Docker images.



== Features

As the Spring SDK is more recent than their gRPC-first counterparts, not all features are supported at this time. However, there's already a lot to play with:

* xref:spring:actions.adoc[Actions]
* xref:spring:value-entity.adoc[Value Entities]
* xref:spring:eventsourced.adoc[Event Sourced Entities]
* xref:spring:views.adoc[Views]

* xref:spring:timers.adoc[Timers]
* xref:spring:service-to-service.adoc[]
* Test kit for Unit Tests and Integration Tests


== Getting Started

You can start a new Kalix project using our xref:spring:getting-started.adoc[Getting started] guide. If you prefer to
first explore a fully implemented Kalix application, you can try our xref:spring:quickstart/cr-value-entity-spring.adoc[Quickstart application].
