= Service to Service Eventing

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]


Kalix provides brokerless at-least-once event delivery across Kalix services through the Service to Service eventing.

The source of the events is an xref:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Event Sourced Entity]. Its events can be published as a stream and consumed by another Kalix service without the need to set up a message broker.

Note:: For eventing from an entity inside the same Kalix service as the consuming component, use regular
xref:actions-publishing-subscribing.adoc[Subscription to the entity] instead of Service to Service eventing.

== Event Producer

The event producer controls which entity to publish events for. Each entity published is identified by a stream `id` so
that one Kalix service can publish more than one of the entity types it contains.

----
<1> Identifying which event sourced entity to publish events for.
<2> Ignore any event types not handled by a method and move on with the event stream, rather than fail which is the default.
<3> Public identifier for consumers of this stream.
<4> Allowing access from other Kalix services, but not the public internet.
<5> All methods on the service are transformer methods for turning internal event message types into public API message types for other services to consume

== Event Consumer

The consumer can be an Action or a View, annotated with `@Subscribe.Stream` with a `service` identifying the publishing service, and the `id` of the stream to subscribe to.

We then define a component subscribing to the service to service publisher. In this example we do that with a View:

----
<1> Annotate the component with `@Subscribe.Stream` to subscribe to an event stream from another Kalix service.
<2> The name of the Kalix service publishing the event stream.
<3> The public identifier of the specific stream from the publisher.
<4> One update method per message type that the stream may contain.
