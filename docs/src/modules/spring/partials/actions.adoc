Actions are stateless functions that can be used to implement different uses cases, such as:

- a pure function
- request conversion - you can use Actions to convert incoming data into a different format before forwarding a call to a different component.
- publish and subscribe to events 
- schedule and cancel timers

Actions can be triggered in multiple ways. For example, by:

- a gRPC service call
- an HTTP service call
- a forwarded call from another component
- a scheduled call from a timer
- an incoming event from within the same service or a from different service
