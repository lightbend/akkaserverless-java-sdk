= Actions as Controller

Actions can be used to implement link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[MVC Controllers] by
acting as the external interface of a service, receiving requests, operating over the requests values and forwarding the call
to other components.

== Defining the `proto` file

To illustrate how you can use an Action as a Controller, we will build on top of the xref:value-entity.adoc[Value Entity Counter] example and add
an Action that will take the incoming `Increase` command, double its value and forward the request to a `Counter` entity.

Note that in this example we are adding an Action to an existing service, the xref:value-entity.adoc[Value Entity Counter] service.

<1> Import the Counter API definition
<2> The protobuf option (akkaserverless.service) is specific to code-generation as provided by the Akka Serverless Maven plugin. This annotation indicates to the code-generation that an Action must be generated.
<3> The Action mimics the Counter API


== Implementing the Action

The class `DoubleCounterAction` gets generated for us based on the proto file defined above.

include::example$java-valueentity-counter/src/main/java/com/example/actions/DoubleCounterAction.java[tag=controller-forward]
----

<1> In the constructor, we use the `ActionCreationContext` to create a `increaseCallRef` pointing to the `Increase` method in the `Counter` entity.
<2> On incoming requests, we double the value of `IncreaseValue`
<3> We use the `increaseCallRef` to build a `ServiceCall` that is then passed to `effects().forward()` method.

== Registering the Action

To make Akka Serverless aware of the Action, we need to register it with the service.

From the code-generation, the registration gets automatically inserted in the generated `AkkaServerlessFactory.withComponents` method from the `Main` class.

When we add an Action to an existing service, like we did here, the `Main` class needs to be adapted. In this example, we build on top
of the  xref:value-entity.adoc[Value Entity Counter] example. Therefore, the generated `AkkaServerlessFactory.withComponents` is now accepting
two registrations: the `Counter` and the `DoubleCounterAction`, and we need to adapt it.
