= Actions as Controller
:page-supergroup-java-scala: Language

Actions can be used to implement link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[MVC Controllers] by
acting as the external interface of a service, receiving requests, operating over the requests values and forwarding the call
to other components in the same service.

To illustrate how you can use an Action as a Controller, we will build on top of the xref:writing-grpc-descriptors-protobuf.adoc[Value Entity Shopping Cart] example, adding a new Action to the existing shopping cart service.

== Forwarding Commands

The `forward` effect allows us to transform or further validate an incoming request before passing it on to another
component and have the response message directly passed back to the client making the request. The response from the
forwarded operation must have the same response type as the original command.

In this example we accept the same command as the entity, `AddLineItem`, but add some additional verification of the
request and only conditionally forward the request to the entity if the verification is successful:

== Transform Request and Response to Another Component

The `asyncReply` and `asyncEffect` effects allow us to process and transform a request before calling another component and then also transform the response.

As an example, let us look at the problem of creating a new entity with an id generated by the service itself.

In this example we implement an `Initialize` command for the controller Action which returns the message `NewCartCreated`
with the entity id that can subsequently be used to interact with the cart.

----
<1> We generate a new UUID
<2> We use `components().shoppingCart().create(...)` to create a `DeferredCall` for `create` on the shopping cart
<3> `execute()` on the `DeferredCall` immediately triggers a call and returns a `CompletionStage` for the response
<4> Once the call succeeds or fails the `CompletionStage` is completed or failed, we can transform the result from `CompletionStage<Empty>`
    to `CompletionStage<Effect<NewCartCreated>>` using `handle`.
<5> On a successful response, we create a reply effect with a `NewCartCreated`
<6> If the call leads to an error, we create an error effect asking the client to retry
<7> `effects().asyncEffect()` allows us to reply with a `CompletionStage<Effect<NewCartCreated>>`

Scala::

----
include::example$scala-valueentity-shopping-cart/src/main/scala/com/example/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartActionImpl.scala[tag=initialize]
----
<1> We generate a new UUID
<2> We use `components.shoppingCart.create(...)` to create a `DeferredCall` for `create` on the shopping cart
<3> `execute()` on the `DeferredCall` immediately triggers a call and returns a `Future` for the response
<4>  On a successful response, we `map` the `Empty` reply to a reply effect with the reply `NewCartCreated`
<5> If the call leads to an error, we `recover` and return an error effect asking the client to retry
<6> `effects.asyncEffect()` allows us to reply with a `Future[Effect[NewCartCreated]]` rather than a reply we already have created

The action generates a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier[UUID] to use as entity id for the shopping cart. UUIDs are extremely unlikely to lead to the same id
being generated, but to completely guarantee two calls can never be assigned the same shopping cart we
make use of the "boundary of consistency" provided by the entity - the entity will only process a single command at a time
and can safely make decisions based on its state - for example to only allow creation once by storing something in its state
signifying that it has been created.

In this case we mark that the entity has been created using a creation timestamp in the shopping cart state stored on first
`create` call (when the timestamp has the default value of `0`). If the cart has already been stored with a timestamp we return an error effect:

== Composing calls

The async call shown in the previous section, can also be used to chain or compose multiple calls to a single action response.

In this example we build on the previous cart creation by adding an initial item in the cart once it has been created,
but before we return the new id to the client:

----
<1> `CompletionStage#thenCompose` allow us to perform an additional async operation, returning a `CompletionStage` once the current one completes successfully
<2> Create a request to add an initial item to the cart
<3> Executing the `addItem` call returns a `CompletionStage<Empty>` once it succeeds
<4> `handle` allows us to transform the successful completion of `addItem` with `Empty` to the response type of this method - `NewCartCreated`
<5> `effects().asyncReply()` lets us reply once the `CompletionStage<NewCartCreated>` completes

Scala::
+
.src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartActionImpl.scala
[source,scala]
----
include::example$scala-valueentity-shopping-cart/src/main/scala/com/example/shoppingcart/ShoppingCartActionImpl.scala[tag=createPrePopulated]
----
<1> For comprehensions (or directly using `flatMap`) allow us to compose the individual async steps returning `Future`
<2> Once both steps have completed, create a `NewCartCreated` leading to a `Future[NewCartCreated]` coming out of the for-comprehension
<3> `effect.asyncReply` lets us reply once the `Future[NewCartCreated]` completes

In this sample it is safe to base a subsequent call to the entity on the reply of the previous one, no client will know
of the cart id until `createPrePopulated` replies.

For many other use cases it is important to understand that there is no transaction or consistency boundary outside of
the entity, so for a sequence of calls from an action to an entity, the state of the entity could be updated by other
calls it receives inbetween.

For example, imagine an action that for a cart id retrieves the state using `getState` to verify if too many items are
already in the cart, and once that has been verified, it adds the item to the cart.

<1> Between this call returning
<2> And this next call to the same entity, the entity could accept other commands that change the total count of items in the cart

----
<1> Between this call returning
<2> And this next call to the same entity, the entity could accept other commands that changes the total count of items in the cart

The problem with this is that an `addItem` call directly to the entity happening between the `getState`
action returning and the `addItem` call from the action would lead to more items in the cart than the allowed limit.

Such validation depending on state can only safely be done handling the command inside of the entity.
