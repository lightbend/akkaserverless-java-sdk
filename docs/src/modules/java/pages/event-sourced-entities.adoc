https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#event_sourced_entity[Event Sourced Entities] persist changes as events and snapshots. Kalix needs to serialize that data to send it to the underlying data store, this is done with Protocol Buffers using `protobuf` types.

While Protocol Buffers are the recommended format for persisting state, we recommend that you do not persist your service's public `protobuf` messages. This may introduce some overhead to convert from one type to the other but allows the service public interface logic to evolve independently of the data storage format, which should be private.

The steps necessary to implement an Event Sourced Entity include:

. Defining the API and domain objects in `.proto` files.
. Implementing behavior in command and event handlers.
. Creating and initializing the Entity.


The sections on this page walk through these steps using a shopping cart service as an example.

== Defining the `proto` files

NOTE: Our Event Sourced Entity example is a shopping cart service.

The following `shoppingcart_domain.proto` file defines our "Shopping" Event Sourced Entity. The entity manages line items of a cart and stores events `ItemAdded` and `ItemRemoved` to represent changes to the cart. Real-world entities store much more data - often structured data - they represent an _Entity_ in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design[domain-driven design] sense of the term.

The `shoppingcart_api.proto` file defines the commands we can send to the shopping cart service to manipulate or access the cart's state. They make up the service API:

== Implementing behavior

An Event Sourced Entity implementation is a class where you define how each command is handled. The class `ShoppingCart` gets generated for us based on the `shoppingcart_api.proto` and `shoppingcart_domain.proto` definitions. Once the file exists, it is not overwritten, so you can freely add logic to it. `ShoppingCart` extends the generated class `AbstractShoppingCart` which we're not supposed to change as it gets regenerated in case we update the protobuf descriptors. `AbstractShoppingCart` contains all method signatures corresponding to the API of the service. If you change the API you will see compilation errors in the `ShoppingCart` class and you have to implement the methods required by `AbstractShoppingCart`.

We need to implement all methods our Event Sourced Entity offers as https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#command_handler[_command handlers_].

The code-generation will generate an implementation class with an initial empty implementation which we'll discuss below.

Command handlers are implemented in the `ShoppingCart` class as methods that override abstract methods from `AbstractShoppingCart`. The methods take the current state as the first parameter and the request message as the second parameter. They return an `Effect`, which describes the next processing actions, such as emitting events and sending a reply.

When adding or changing the `rpc` definitions, including name, parameter, and return messages, in the `.proto` files the corresponding methods are regenerated in the abstract class (`AbstractShoppingCart`). This means that the Java compiler will assist you with such changes. The IDE can typically fill in missing method signatures and such.

=== Updating state

In the example below, the `AddItem` service call uses the request message `AddLineItem`. It returns an `Effect` to emit an event and then sends a reply once the event is stored successfully. The state is updated by the event handler.

IMPORTANT: The **only** way for a command handler to modify the Entity's state is by emitting an event. Any modifications made directly to the state (or instance variables) from the command handler are not persisted. When the Entity is passivated and reloaded, those modifications will not be present.

<1> The validation ensures the quantity of items added is greater than zero and it fails calls with illegal values by returning an `Effect` with `effects().error`.
<2> From the current incoming `AddLineItem` we create a new `ItemAdded` event representing the change of the cart.
<3> We store the event by returning an `Effect` with `effects().emitEvent`.
<4> The acknowledgment that the command was successfully processed is only sent if the event was successfully stored, otherwise there will be an error reply.

The new state is created from the event and the previous state in the event handler. Event handlers are implemented in the `ShoppingCart` class as methods that override abstract methods from `AbstractShoppingCart`. Event handlers are generated for each event declared in  `(kalix.codegen).event_sourced_entity.events`.

=== Retrieving state

The following example shows the implementation of the `GetCart` command handler. This command handler is a read-only command handler--it doesn't update the state, it just returns it:

<1> The current state is passed to the method.
<2> We convert the domain representation to the API representation that is sent as a reply by returning an `Effect` with `effects().reply`.

<2> We convert the domain representation to the API representation that is sent as a reply by returning an `Effect` with `effects.reply`.


== Registering the Entity

To make Kalix aware of the Event Sourced Entity, we need to register it with the service.

From the code-generation, the registration gets automatically inserted in the generated `KalixFactory.withComponents` method from the `Main` class.

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java]
.src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/Main.java
----
include::example$java-eventsourced-shopping-cart/src/main/java/com/example/shoppingcart/Main.java[]
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala]
.src/main/scala/com/example/shoppingcart/Main.scala
----
include::example$scala-eventsourced-shopping-cart/src/main/scala/com/example/shoppingcart/Main.scala[]
----


By default, the generated constructor has an `EventSourcedEntityContext` parameter, but you can change this to accept other parameters. If you change the constructor of the `ShoppingCart` class you will see a compilation error here, and you have to adjust the factory function that is passed to `KalixFactory.withComponents`.

When more components are added the `KalixFactory` is regenerated and you have to adjust the registration from the `Main` class.

== Snapshots

include::ROOT:partial$eventsourced-snapshots.adoc[]

== Testing the Entity

The following snippet shows how the `ShoppingCartTestKit` is used to test the `ShoppingCart` implementation. Kalix provides two main APIs for unit tests, the `ShoppingCartTestKit` and the `EventSourcedResult`. The former gives us the overall state of the entity. Its state and all the events produced by all the calls to the Entity. While the latter only holds the effects produced for each individual call to the Entity.

*EventSourcedResult*

[.tabset]
Java::

Calling a command handler through the TestKit gives us back an link:{attachmentsdir}/testkit/kalix/javasdk/testkit/EventSourcedResult.html[`EventSourcedResult` {tab-icon}, window="new"]. This class has methods that we can use to assert of handling the command, such as:
+
* `getReply()` - the response from the command handler if there was one, if not an, exception is thrown, failing the test.
* `getAllEvents()` - all the events emitted by handling the command.
* `getState()` - the state of the entity after applying any events the command handler emitted.
* `getNextEventOfType(ExpectedEvent.class)` - check the next of the emitted events against an event type, return it for inspection if it matches, or fail the test if it does not. The event gets consumed once is inspected and the next call will look for a subsequent event.
