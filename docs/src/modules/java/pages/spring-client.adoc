= Using Spring to consume Kalix Services

This guide provides a simple example of how a Spring client can be built to interact with a Kalix Service.

== What You Will Build

You will build a Kalix Service along with a Spring client to interact with that Service.

The Kalix Service will create, read, update and persist simple counters.

The Spring client will expose the functionality of the Kalix Service as a REST API.

== What You Need

- About 15 minutes
- A favorite text editor or IDE
- https://adoptium.net/[JDK 11] or later
- https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Maven 3.6] or later
- https://www.docker.com/[Docker 20.10.8] or higher

== How to get started

To get started, do the following:

- https://github.com/lightbend/kalix-jvm-sdk/archive/refs/heads/main.zip[Download] and unzip the source repository for this guide, or clone it using Git:

`git clone https://github.com/lightbend/kalix-jvm-sdk.git`

- cd into `kalix-jvm-sdk/samples/java-valueentity-counter`

== Build and Run the Kalix Service Locally

With the source repository downloaded, you can build and run the Kalix Service locally.

Run the Kalix Service using Maven:

`mvn compile exec:exec`

You should see output similar to the following:

```
[INFO] --- exec-maven-plugin:3.0.0:exec (default-cli) @ valueentity-counter ---
{"timestamp":"2022-03-02T23:38:12.174Z","thread":"main","logger":"com.example.Main","message":"starting the Kalix service","context":"default","severity":"INFO"}
{"timestamp":"2022-03-02T23:38:12.829Z","thread":"kalix-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-2","logger":"akka.event.slf4j.Slf4jLogger","message":"Slf4jLogger started","context":"default","severity":"INFO"}
```

== Build and Run the Kalix proxy locally

In another terminal window, run the Kalix proxy using Docker:

`docker compose up`

You should see output similar to the following:app-name:

```
kalix-proxy_1   | {"timestamp":"2022-03-02T23:40:40.766Z","mdc":{"akkaAddress":"akka://kalix-proxy@172.21.0.2:25520","akkaSource":"akka://kalix-proxy/user/discovery-manager","sourceActorSystem":"kalix-proxy"},"logger":"io.kalix.proxy.DiscoveryManager","message":"gRPC proxy started at 0.0.0.0:9000","severity":"INFO","thread":"kalix-proxy-akka.actor.default-dispatcher-8"}
```

== Building Spring REST Client

The Spring REST Client would enable Spring application to integrate with REST endpoints exposed via Kalix Service.

=== Create a Spring Boot Project

Starting with Spring Initializr

Navigate to https://start.spring.io. This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.

Choose Maven and the Java language.

Click Dependencies and select Spring Reactive Web.

Click Generate.

Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

=== Create a Spring WebClient

Creating a Spring REST WebClient would allow Spring application to communicate with the REST Endpoints exposed via Kalix Service.

cd into `kalix-jvm-sdk/samples/java-valueentity-counter-spring-client`.

Now you can create a `WebClient`. You need to configure the WebClient to use the Kalix Service's host and port. The following listing shows how to do so:

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/config/WebClientConfig.java
----
include::example$java-valueentity-counter-spring-client/src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/config/WebClientConfig.java[tag=webclientconfig]
----

=== Create a Spring Service

The Service methods interact with endpoints defined in Kalix Service.

The `CounterServiceImpl` shown in the following listing uses the Spring REST WebClient to interact with the Kalix Service and return the response received from called endpoint:

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/service/CounterServiceImpl.java
----
include::example$java-valueentity-counter-spring-client/src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/service/CounterServiceImpl.java[tag=getCurrentCounterCall]
----

=== Create a Spring Controller

The Controller defines the Spring application REST endpoints which will be exposed to the user for interaction.

The `CounterController` shown in the following listing uses the Spring service to get actual processing done:

[source,java,indent=0]
./src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/controller/CounterController.java
----
include::example$java-valueentity-counter-spring-client/src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/controller/CounterController.java[tag=getCounterEndpoint]
----

=== Create a Spring Main Application

The Main Application class defines the starting point for spring boot application.

The `CounterClientApplication` shown in the following listing starts spring application:

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/CounterClientApplication.java
----
include::example$java-valueentity-counter-spring-client/src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/CounterClientApplication.java[tag=counterApplication]
----

===  Build and Run the Spring Application Locally

In project root directory, run the following command
`mvn spring-boot:run`


== Building Spring gRPC Client

The Spring gRPC Client would enable Spring application to integrate with gRPC services exposed via Kalix Service.

=== Create a Spring Boot Project

Starting with Spring Initializr

Navigate to https://start.spring.io. This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.

Choose Maven and the Java language.

Click Dependencies and select Spring Reactive Web.

Click Generate.

Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

=== Generate gRPC stubs

- Get all the proto files from relevant Kalix service and copy under `src/main/proto` folder.  Remove all the Kalix annotations from the proto files. For instance `[(kalix.field).entity_key = true]` and `kalix.codegen` etc.
 For instance,  copying proto files from to `java-valueentity-counter/src/main/proto/com/example`.

- Run `mvn compile` to generate stubs.

=== Create a Spring gRPC Client

Creating a Spring gRPC would allow Spring application to communicate with the gRPC Services exposed via Kalix Service.

cd into `kalix-jvm-sdk/samples/java-valueentity-counter-spring-client`.

Now you can create a `GrpcClientConfig`. You need to configure the gRPC Client to use the Kalix Service's host and port. The following listing shows how to do so:

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/config/GrpcClientConfig.java
----

----

=== Create a Spring Service

The Service methods interact with gRPC services defined in Kalix Service.

The `GrpcClientService` shown in the following listing uses the Spring REST WebClient to interact with the Kalix Service and return the response received from called endpoint:

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/service/GrpcClientService.java
----
include::example$java-valueentity-counter-spring-client/src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/service/GrpcClientService.java[tag=decreaseCounterCall]
----

=== Create a Spring Controller

The Controller defines the Spring application REST endpoints which will be exposed to the user for interaction.

The `CounterController` shown in the following listing uses the Spring service to get actual processing done:

[source,java,indent=0]
./src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/controller/CounterController.java
----
include::example$java-valueentity-counter-spring-client/src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/controller/CounterController.java[tag=getCounterEndpoint]
----

=== Create a Spring Main Application

The Main Application class defines the starting point for spring boot application.

The `CounterClientApplication` shown in the following listing starts spring application:

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/CounterClientApplication.java
----
include::example$java-valueentity-counter-spring-client/src/main/java/com/example/client/spring/rest/CounterClientApplication.java[tag=counterApplication]
----

=== Build and Run the Spring Application Locally

In project root directory, run the following command
`mvn spring-boot:run`
