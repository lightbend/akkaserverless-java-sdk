A very common use case when building Microservices is to publish and subscribe to a stream of events. The source of events can be the journal of an event sourced entity, the value entity state changes, a https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview[Google Cloud Pub/Sub] or https://kafka.apache.org/[Apache Kafka] topic for asynchronous messaging between services.

In this section, we will explore how you can use an Action to:

- Subscribe to events emitted by an event sourced entity within the same service.
- Subscribe to state changes emitted by a value entity within the same service.
- Subscribe to events from Event Sourced Entities published as service to service eventing.
- Subscribe to external events from topics of Google Cloud Pub/Sub or Apache Kafka.
- Publish events to a Google Cloud Pub/Sub or Apache Kafka topic.

WARNING: Messages are guaranteed to be delivered at least once. This means that receivers must be able to handle duplicate messages.


== Publishing Entity events to a Topic

To illustrate how to publish entity events, let's assume the existence of an Event Sourced Counter entity that emits events of types: `ValueIncreased` and `ValueDecreased`. You will get the events delivered to an Action, apply some transformation and let them be published to a topic.

You can subscribe an Action to events from an Event Source Entity by annotating a method with `@Subscribe.EventSourcedEntity` and specifying the class of the entity. The input type of the method must be the same of the events generated by the entity.

To publish the events you need to add the annotation `@Publish.Topic` to the method subscribed to the events and add the name of the topic.

include::example$java-spring-eventsourced-counter/src/main/java/com/example/actions/CounterJournalToTopicAction.java[tag=class]
----
<1> Subscribing to the events from the Counter.
<2> Publishing to a topic name 'counter-events'.
<3> Setting the method input type to the events produced by the counter.
<4> Any return `Action.Effect` response is valid.


== Subscribing to a Value Entity

You can subscribe an Action to events from a Value Entity. It works the same as an Event Sourced Entity except for the annotation. To receive messages from the entity, annotate a service method `@Subscribe.ValueEntity` and specify the class of the entity.

== Type level annotations for subscribing

You can subscribe to a topic or an Event Source Entity by adding `@Subscribe` as a type level annotation, at the top of the class. This provides additional functionality for subscribing: all methods returning `Action.Effect` are selected to process incoming events. The Action will fail if it receives an event for which there is no method handler, unless the subscription is set with `ignoreUnknown = true`.

In the following example you can take a look at how the Action is configured to ignore unknown messages because it only has a method handler for `ValueIncrease`, while it could also receive a `ValueMultiplied`.

----
include::example$java-spring-eventsourced-counter/src/main/java/com/example/actions/SubscribeTypeLevelAction.java[tag=class]
----
<1> Set to ignore unknown events.
<2> Only processing `ValueIncreased` events.
<3> Any return is valid.

If you don't add `ignoreUnknown=true`, the action would fail when processing a `ValueMultiplied`. The default is false.

== Subscribing and acting upon

Another possible usage for Actions is to consume events and act upon.

For example, you may consume events from one entity or from a topic, transform to commands and send to another entity or an external system. This is similar to the usage explained in xref:actions-as-controller.adoc[Actions as Controller], except that the Action is driven by the flow of incoming events instead of external user requests.

== Service to Service Eventing

A Kalix application can be comprised of multiple services working to support specific business requirements. Although each service is an independent deployable unit, often times information needs to flow between those services.

Kalix provides brokerless at-least-once event delivery across Kalix services through the Service to Service eventing.

The source of the events is an xref:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Event Sourced Entity]. Its events can be published as a stream and consumed by another Kalix service without the need to set up a message broker.

Note:: For eventing from an entity inside the same Kalix service as the consuming component, use regular
xref:actions-publishing-subscribing.adoc[Subscription to the entity] instead of Service to Service eventing.

=== Event Producer

The event producer controls which entity to publish events for. Each entity published is identified by a stream `id` so
that one Kalix service can publish more than one of the entity types it contains.

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/customer/api/CustomerEventsService.java
----
include::example$java-spring-eventsourced-customer-registry/src/main/java/customer/api/CustomerEventsService.java[tag=producer]
----
<1> Identifying which event sourced entity to publish events for.
<2> Ignore any event types not handled by a method and move on with the event stream, rather than fail which is the default.
<3> Public identifier for consumers of this stream.
<4> Allowing access from other Kalix services, but not the public internet.
<5> All methods on the service are transformer methods for turning internal event message types into public API message types for other services to consume.

=== Event Consumer

The consumer can be an Action or a View, annotated with `@Subscribe.Stream` with a `service` identifying the publishing service, and the `id` of the stream to subscribe to.

We then define a component subscribing to the service to service publisher. In this example we do that with a View:

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/customer/views/CustomersByNameView.java
----
include::example$java-spring-eventsourced-customer-registry-subscriber/src/main/java/customer/views/CustomersByNameView.java[tag=view]
----
<1> Annotate the component with `@Subscribe.Stream` to subscribe to an event stream from another Kalix service.
<2> The name of the Kalix service publishing the event stream.
<3> The public identifier of the specific stream from the publisher.
<4> One update method per message type that the stream may contain.

TIP: If you're looking to test this locally, you will likely need to run the 2 services in different ports. For more details, consult xref:running-locally.adoc#_running_multiple_services_locally[Running multiple services].

=== Deployment-dependent sources

It is possible to use environment variables to control the name of the service that a consumer consumes from, this is useful for example for using the same image in staging and production deployments but having them consume from different source services.

Referencing environment variables is done with the syntax `$\{VAR_NAME}` in the `service` parameter of the `@Subscribe.Stream` annotation.

WARNING: Changing the `service` name after it has once been deployed means the consumer will start over from the beginning of the event stream.

See https://docs.kalix.io/kalix/kalix_services_deploy.html[kalix service deploy] for details on how to set environment variables when deploying a service.



== Handling Serialization

Check xref:serialization.adoc[serialization] documentation for more details.

== Subscribing to a Topic

To receive messages from a Google Cloud Pub/Sub or Apache Kafka topic, annotate the service method `@Subscribe.Topic` and specify the topic name.

In the following example the events from the topic are delivered to the Action and logged.

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/actions/CounterTopicSubscriptionAction.java
----
include::example$java-spring-eventsourced-counter/src/main/java/com/example/actions/CounterTopicSubscriptionAction.java[tags=class]
----
<1> Subscribing to the `ValueIncreased` from topic 'counter-events'.
<2> Setting the method input type to the events produced by the counter.
<3> Any return is valid.
<4> Subscribing to the `ValueMultiplied` from topic 'counter-events'.
<5> Setting the method input type to the events produced by the counter.
<6> Any return is valid.

The events from the topic are delivered to the Action. The implementation may vary: for this simplified example you are just logging it, but it could be a forward to some other component or external service.

The return value of the method is an `Action.Effect` with message `Confirmed`, but can be any other of type `Action.Effect<>` if the return type of the method defines it. The Kalix framework needs the type `Effect` to ensure that the event was successfully processed. If no exception is thrown and the method returns a `effects().reply`, the framework assumes that the event was successfully processed and marks it as such. This allows the next event to be sent to the subscribing method. 

However, if an exception is raised and not handled, or the method return `effects().error()` this action will not process any more events until the necessary handling of the current event is added such its return is a `reply`. Otherwise, it will raise the same error over and over again until the application is fixed and restarted.

IMPORTANT: By default, Kalix assumes the messages in the topic were serialized as JSON and as such, deserializes them into the input type of your method by taking advantage of CloudEvents standard.

=== Receiving CloudEvents
Kalix uses the https://cloudevents.io/[CloudEvents] standard when receiving from and publishing to topics. The CloudEvents specification standardizes message metadata so that systems can integrate more easily.

Describing the structure of the message payload is the CloudEvents feature most important to Kalix.

An example of that is the capability to send serialized JSON messages and have Kalix deserialize them accordingly.

IMPORTANT: To allow proper reading of JSON messages from external topics, the messages need to specify the message attributes:

- `Content-Type` = `application/json`
- `ce-specversion` = `1.0`
- `ce-type` = fully qualified name (e.g.  `com.example.ValueIncreased`)

(The `ce-` prefixed attributes are part of the CloudEvents specification.)

=== Receiving Bytes

If the content type is `application/octet-stream`, no content type is present, or the type is unknown to Kalix, the message is treated as a binary message. The topic subscriber method must accept the `byte[]` message.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/com/example/actions/SubscribeRawBytesAction.java
----
include::example$java-spring-eventsourced-counter/src/main/java/com/example/actions/SubscribeToRawBytesAction.java[tag=class]
----
<1> When consuming raw bytes messages from a topic the input type must be `byte[]`.

If an action has a return type of `byte[]` and publishes to a topic, the events published to the topic will have content-type `application/octet-stream`.

=== Deployment-dependent names

It is possible to use environment variables to control the name of the topic that is used for consuming from or producing events to, this is useful for example for using the same image in staging and production deployments but having them interact with separate topics.

Referencing environment variables is done with the syntax `$\{VAR_NAME}` in the `value` parameter of the `@Subscribe.Topic` annotation. See https://docs.kalix.io/kalix/kalix_services_deploy.html[kalix service deploy] for details on how to set environment variables when deploying a service.

WARNING: Changing the `topic` name after it has once been deployed for an event consumer means the consumer will start over from the beginning of the topic.


== Accessing the Entity ID

For many use cases, a subscriber to an event log will trigger other services and needs to pass the entity ID to the receiver. The events of an Event Sourced entity, by design, do not include the entity ID, but it is made available to the subscriber via the metadata field `subject`, accessible through `eventSubject` in the  link:{attachmentsdir}/api/io/kalix/javasdk/action/ActionContext.html[`ActionContext`{tab-icon}, window="new"].

You can access the link:{attachmentsdir}/api/kalix/javasdk/action/ActionContext.html[`ActionContext`{tab-icon}, window="new"] through method `actionContext()`.

== Testing the Integration

include::java:partial$eventing-testkit-intro.adoc[leveloffset=1]

[source,java]
.src/it/java/com/example/CounterIntegrationTest.java
----
include::example$java-spring-eventsourced-counter/src/it/java/com/example/CounterIntegrationTest.java[tags=class;test-topic]
----
<1> Start the TestKit, booting up both the service and the Kalix Runtime.
<2> Wire the Kalix TestKit automatically.
<3> Get a `IncomingMessages` for topic named `counter-commands` and `OutgoingMessages` for `counter-events` from the TestKit.
<4> Build 2 commands and publish both to the topic. Note the `counterId` is passed as the subject id of the message.
<5> Read 2 messages, one at a time. We pass in the expected class type for the next message.
<6> Assert the received messages have the same value as the commands sent.

TIP: In the example above we take advantage of the TestKit to serialize / deserialize the messages and pass all the required metadata automatically for us. However, the API also offers the possibility to read and write raw bytes, construct your metadata or read multiple messages at once.

==== Configuration

Before running your test, make sure to configure the TestKit correctly.

[source, java]
.src/it/java/com/example/TestKitConfiguration.java
----
include::example$java-spring-eventsourced-counter/src/it/java/com/example/TestKitConfiguration.java[tags=class;eventing-config]
----
<1> Mock incoming messages from the `counter-commands` topic.
<2> Mock outgoing messages from the `counter-events` topic.

==== Metadata

Typically, messages are published with associated metadata. If you want to construct your own `Metadata` to be consumed by a service or make sure the messages published out of your service have specific metadata attached, you can do so using the TestKit, as shown below.

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/it/java/com/example/CounterTopicIntegrationTest.java
----
include::example$java-spring-eventsourced-counter/src/it/java/com/example/CounterIntegrationTest.java[tag=test-topic-metadata]
----
<1> Build a `CloudEvent` object with the 3 required attributes, respectively: `id`, `source` and `type`.
<2> Add the subject to which the message is related, that is the `counterId`.
<3> Set the mandatory header "Content-Type" accordingly.
<4> Publish the message along with its metadata to topic `commandsTopic`.
<5> Upon receiving the message, access the metadata.
<6> Assert the headers `Content-Type` and `ce-subject` (every CloudEvent header is prefixed with "ce-") have the expected values.


==== One Suite, Multiple Tests

When running multiple test cases under the same test suite and thus using a common TestKit instance, you might face some issues if unconsumed messages from previous tests mess up with the current one. To avoid this, be sure to:

- have the tests run in sequence, not in parallel;
- clear the contents of the topics in use before the test.

As an alternative, you can consider using different test suites which will use independent TestKit instances.


[source,java,indent=0]
.src/it/java/com/example/CounterTopicIntegrationTest.java
----
include::example$java-spring-eventsourced-counter/src/it/java/com/example/CounterIntegrationTest.java[tag=clear-topics]
----
<1> Run this before each test.
<2> Clear the topic ignoring any unread messages.

NOTE: Despite the example, you are neither forced to clear all topics nor to do it before each test. You can do it selectively, or you might not even need it depending on your tests and the flows they test.

=== External Broker

To run an integration test against a real instance of Google PubSub (or its Emulator) or Kafka, use the TestKit settings to override the default eventing support, as shown below:
