= Component and Service Calls
:page-aliases: spring:call-another-service.adoc, java:call-another-service.adoc

Typically, a Kalix service comprises many components. Such components might dependent on one another, on other Kalix services or even external services. This section describes how to call other components and services from within a Kalix service.

== Kalix components

Since Kalix is an auto-scaling solution, components can be distributed across many nodes within the same service. Kalix doesnâ€™t hide this fact and makes it explicit. That's why calling Kalix components is done via HTTP/gRPC `DeferredCall` calls. A `DeferredCall` is just an instruction on how to call a given component, which can be optimized by the Kalix engine (see xref:java:actions.adoc#_forwarding_commands[forwarding]). Sometimes it's necessary to transform the `DeferredCall` into the `CompletionStage` to combine many different component calls and build a single xref:java:actions.adoc#_composing_calls[asynchronous reply].

=== Component Client

The Kalix `ComponentClient` is a utility for creating deferred calls in a type-safe way. You don't have to remember what the endpoint path is or which HTTP method should be selected for the call. To use the `ComponentClient` you need to inject it into your component (an Action in this example):

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/fibonacci/LimitedFibonacciAction.java
----
include::java:example$java-spring-fibonacci-action/src/main/java/com/example/fibonacci/LimitedFibonacciAction.java[tag=injecting-component-client]
----
<1> Declare a field for the `ComponentClient`.
<2> Have a constructor that accepts the `ComponentClient` as an argument.
<3> Assign the `ComponentClient` to the field.

With the `componentClient` available on your component, you can use it to create a `DeferredCall`. Constructing the call is a matter of:

* selecting the component type,
* choosing the endpoint, with a Java method reference,
* passing in parameters, if expected.

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/fibonacci/LimitedFibonacciAction.java
----
include::java:example$java-spring-fibonacci-action/src/main/java/com/example/fibonacci/LimitedFibonacciAction.java[tag=component-client]
----
<1> Select Action component.
<2> Select endpoint method reference.
<3> Pass in endpoint method arguments.

NOTE: Calling endpoints that return a stream response like `Flux` is not supported currently by the `ComponentClient`.

== Kalix services

Calling other Kalix services in the same project from an Action is done by invoking them using a https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.0.13.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-client[`Spring WebFlux WebClient`]. The service is identified by the name it has been deployed. Kalix takes care of routing requests to the service and keeping the data safe by encrypting the connection for you.

In this sample we will make an action that does a call to the xref:value-entity.adoc[Value Entity Counter] service, deployed with the service name `counter`.

The Kalix Java SDK provides a utility class `WebClientProvider` that can provide previously configured `WebClient`s to reach other Kalix services deployed on the same Kalix project.

In our delegating service implementation:

[source,java,indent=0]
.src/main/java/com/example/callanotherservice/DelegatingServiceAction.java
----
include::java:example$java-spring-doc-snippets/src/main/java/com/example/callanotherservice/DelegatingServiceAction.java[tag=delegating-action]
----
<1> Let the `WebClientProvider` be injected into the Action with constructor injection.
<2> Use the `WebClientProvider` to build a `WebClient` for the *counter* service.
<3> Use the `WebClient` to make a REST call to the *counter* service.
<4> Use the remote call result to create a reply.

== External services

Calling Kalix services deployed on *different* projects or any other external service, is done by configuring specific `WebClients`.

See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.0.13.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/web-reactive.html#webflux-client[`Spring WebFlux WebClient`]
documentation for details on configuring the `WebClients`.
