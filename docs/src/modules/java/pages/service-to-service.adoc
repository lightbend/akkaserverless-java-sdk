= Service to Service Eventing
:page-supergroup-java-scala: Language

Kalix provides brokerless at-least-once event delivery across Kalix services through the Service to Service eventing.

The source of the events is an xref:event-sourced-entities.adoc[Event Sourced Entity], that the service provides a Service to Service publisher for.

Note:: For eventing from an entity inside the same Kalix service as the consuming component, use regular xref:actions-publishing-subscribing.adoc[Subscription to the entity] instead of Service to Service eventing.

== Event Producer

The event producer controls which entity to publish events for. Each entity published is identified by a `stream id` so that one Kalix service can publish more than one of the entity types it contains.

The implementation of the producer creates the public API messages and uses the regular Action `effects` API to return the messages to publish:

== Event Consumer

The consumer can be an Action or a View, annotated with `(kalix.service).eventing.in.direct` with a `service` identifying the publishing service, and the `event_stream_id` to subscribe to.

Since the consumer is in a separate View, we must include the message descriptors for the messages the producing side produces:

.src/main/proto/customer/api/publisher_api.proto
----
include::example$scala-eventsourced-customer-registry-subscriber/src/main/proto/customer/api/publisher_api.proto[tag=messages]
----

We then define a component subscribing to the service to service publisher. In this example we do that with a View:

----
<1> Service level `eventing.in.direct` block
<2> The name of the Kalix service publishing the event stream
<3> The public `event_stream_id` of the specific stream from the publisher
<4> One update method per message type that the stream may contain
