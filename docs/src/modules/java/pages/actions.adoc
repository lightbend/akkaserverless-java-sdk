= Implementing Actions in Java

== Defining the `proto` file

An Action may implement any service method defined in a Protobuf definition. In this first example, we will show how to
implement an Action as a pure stateless function. We will define a `FibonacciAction` that takes a number and return the
next number in the Fibonacci series.

[source,protobuf,indent=0]
.src/main/proto/actions/fibonacci.proto

include::example$fibonacci-action/src/main/proto/actions/fibonacci.proto[tag=actions]
----
<1> Any classes generated from this protobuf file will be in the Java package `com.example.fibonacci`.
<2> Import the Akka Serverless protobuf annotations, or options.
<3> Let the messages declared in this protobuf file be inner classes to the Java class `FibonacciApi`.
<4> The protobuf option (akkaserverless.service) is specific to code-generation as provided by the Akka Serverless Maven plugin. This annotation indicates to the code-generation that an Action must be generated.


== Implementing the Action

An Action implementation is a Java class where you define how each message is handled. The class
`FibonacciAction` gets generated for us based on the proto file defined above. Once the
`FibonacciAction.java` file exist, it is not overwritten, so you can freely add logic to it.
`FibonacciAction` extends the generated class `AbstractFibonacciAction` which we're
not supposed to change as it gets regenerated in case we update the protobuf descriptors.

`AbstractFibonacciAction` contains all method signatures corresponding to the API of the service.
If you change the API you will see compilation errors in the `FibonacciAction` class, and you have to
implement the methods required by `AbstractFibonacciAction`.

<1> Extends the generated `AbstractFibonacciAction`, which extends link:{attachmentsdir}/api/com/akkaserverless/javasdk/action/Action.html[`Action` {tab-icon}, window="new"].
<2> A `nextNumber` method is generated. We will implement it next.

Next we can implement `nextNumber` method to complete our Action.

<1> We add two private methods to support the computation. `isFibonacci` checks if a number is a Fibonacci number and
`nextFib` calculates the next number.
<2> The `nextNumber` implementation first checks if the input number belongs to the Fibonacci series. If so, it calculates the
next number and builds a reply using `effects().reply()`.
<3> Otherwise, if the input number doesn't belong to the Fibonacci series, it builds an `Effect` reply error.

=== Multiple replies / reply streaming

An Action may return data conditionally by marking the return type as `stream` in Protobuf. The Java method implementing
that service must return an https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/stream-flows-and-basics.html[Akka Streams Source]
to fulfill that contract.

The Source may publish an arbitrary number of replies.

== Registering the Action

To make Akka Serverless aware of the Action, we need to register it with the service.

From the code-generation, the registration gets automatically inserted in the generated `AkkaServerlessFactory.withComponents` method from the `Main` class.

[source,java]
./src/main/java/com/example/Main.java
----
include::java:example$fibonacci-action/src/main/java/com/example/Main.java[]
----

By default, the generated constructor has a `ActionCreationContext` parameter, but you can change this to accept other parameters. 
If you change the constructor of the `FibonacciAction` class you will see a compilation error here, and you have to adjust the 
factory function that is passed to `AkkaServerlessFactory.withComponents`.

When more components are added the `AkkaServerlessFactory` is regenerated, and you have to adjust the registration from the `Main` class.
