== Defining the `proto` file

An Action may implement any service method defined in a Protobuf definition. In this first example, we will show how to
implement an Action as a pure stateless function. We will define a `FibonacciAction` that takes a number and return the
next number in the Fibonacci series.

<3> Let the messages declared in this protobuf file be inner classes to the Java class `FibonacciApi`.

== Implementing the Action

An Action implementation is a class where you define how each message is handled. The class
`FibonacciAction` gets generated for us based on the proto file defined above. Once the
[.group-java]#`FibonacciAction.java`# [.group-scala]#`FibonacciAction.scala`# file exists, it is not overwritten, so you can freely add logic to it.
`FibonacciAction` extends the generated class `AbstractFibonacciAction` which we're
not supposed to change as it gets regenerated in case we update the protobuf descriptors.

`AbstractFibonacciAction` contains all method signatures corresponding to the API of the service.
If you change the API you will see compilation errors in the `FibonacciAction` class, and you have to
implement the methods required by `AbstractFibonacciAction`.

----
<1> Extends the generated `AbstractFibonacciAction`, which extends link:{attachmentsdir}/api/com/akkaserverless/javasdk/action/Action.html[`Action` {tab-icon}, window="new"].
<2> A `nextNumber` method is generated. We will implement it next.

<2> A `nextNumber` method is generated. We will implement it next.

Next, we can implement `nextNumber` method to complete our Action.

----
<1> We add two private methods to support the computation. `isFibonacci` checks if a number is a Fibonacci number and
`nextFib` calculates the next number.
<2> The `nextNumber` implementation first checks if the input number belongs to the Fibonacci series. If so, it calculates the
next number and builds a reply using `effects().reply()`.
<3> Otherwise, if the input number doesn't belong to the Fibonacci series, it builds an `Effect` reply error.

=== Multiple replies / reply streaming

An Action may return data conditionally by marking the return type as `stream` in Protobuf. The Java method implementing
that service must return an https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/stream-flows-and-basics.html[Akka Streams Source]
to fulfill that contract.

The Source may publish an arbitrary number of replies.

== Registering the Action

To make Akka Serverless aware of the Action, we need to register it with the service.

From the code-generation, the registration gets automatically inserted in the generated `AkkaServerlessFactory.withComponents` method from the `Main` class.

[.tabset]
Java::
+
[source,java]
./src/main/java/com/example/Main.java
----
include::java:example$java-fibonacci-action/src/main/java/com/example/Main.java[]
----

Scala::
+
[source,scala]
./src/main/scala/com/example/fibonacci/Main.scala
----
include::example$scala-fibonacci-action/src/main/scala/com/example/fibonacci/Main.scala[]
----

By default, the generated constructor has an `ActionCreationContext` parameter, but you can change this to accept other parameters. 
If you change the constructor of the `FibonacciAction` class you will see a compilation error here, and you have to adjust the 
factory function that is passed to `AkkaServerlessFactory.withComponents`.

When more components are added the `AkkaServerlessFactory` is regenerated, and you have to adjust the registration from the `Main` class.

== Testing the Action 


=== Unit tests

The following snippet shows how the `FibonacciActionTestKit` is used to test the `FibonacciAction` implementation.

Akka Serverless generates the `FibonacciActionTestKit` that allows us to call the methods of `FibonacciAction`. For each `Action` Akka Serverless generates a specific test kit for it, with the name `[ActionName]TestKit`. Each call we execute over to the test kit returns an `ActionResult` that holds the effect produced by the underlying action method.

Apart from the test kit Akka Serverless generates test classes based on the Action defined in the `.proto` files. This is shown in the snippet below.

NOTE: Actions are unique units of computation where no local state is shared with previous or subsequent calls. The framework doesn't reuse an Action instance but creates a new one for each command handled and therefore it is also how the test kit behaves.

<1> The test kit is created to allow us to test the Action's method.
<2> We call `nextNumber` method with some value.
<3> The reply message from the result is retrieved using `getReply()`.

*ActionResult*
+
Calling an action method through the test kit gives us back an link:{attachmentsdir}/testkit/com/akkaserverless/javasdk/testkit/ActionResult.html[`ActionResult` {tab-icon}, window="new"]. This class has methods that we can use to assert our expectations, such as:
+
* `getReply()` returns the reply message passed to `effects().reply()` or throws an exception failing the test, if the effect returned was not a reply.
* `getError()` returns the error description when `effects().error()` was returned to signal an error.
* `getForward()` returns details about what message was forwarded and where the call was forwarded (since it is a unit test the forward is not actually executed).
