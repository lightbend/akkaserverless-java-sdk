= Quickstart: Customer Registry with Views in Java

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]
include::java:partial$attributes.adoc[]

Create a customer registry that includes queries in Java, package it into a container, and run it on Akka Serverless.

== In this Quickstart you will learn:

* How to add additional functionality, allowing customers to be queried by name and email.
* How to package the customer registry into a container.
* How to deploy and run the customer registry on Akka Serverless.

== Before you begin

* If you're new to Akka Serverless, {console}[create an account, window="console"] so you can try out Akka Serverless for free.
* You'll also need to install the https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/akkasls/install-akkasls.html[Akka Serverless CLI, window="new-doc"] to deploy from a terminal window.
* For this quickstart, you'll also need
** https://docs.docker.com/engine/install[Docker {minimum_docker_version} or higher, window="new"]
** Java {java-version} or higher
** https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.x or higher, window="new"]
** https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#installation[`grpcurl`, window="new"]

[NOTE]
====
If you want to bypass writing code and jump straight to the deployment:

. Download the source code using the Akka Serverless CLI: 
`akkasls quickstart download customer-registry-views-java`

. Skip to <<Package and deploy your service>>.
====

== Start from the Customer Registry Entity

Start by downloading the  xref:java:quickstart/cr-value-entity-java.adoc[Customer Registry Quickstart] source code using the Akka Serverless CLI:

[source,command line]
----
akkasls quickstart download customer-registry-java
----

You can access the `Customer` https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/reference/glossary.html#entity[Entity] with its https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/reference/glossary.html#entity_key[Entity key]. In this guide we will describe how to retrieve customers by email or name instead.

== Define the CustomerByEmail View

. In your project, create a directory for your views protobuf files, `src/main/proto/customer/view`.
[.tabset]
Linux or macOS::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
mkdir -p ./src/main/proto/customer/view
----
--
Windows 10+::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
mkdir src/main/proto/customer/view
----
--

. Create a `customer_view.proto` file and save it in the `src/main/proto/customer/view` directory.

+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.src/main/proto/customer/view/customer_view.proto
----
include::example$java-customer-registry-views-quickstart/src/main/proto/customer/view/customer_view.proto[tag=declarations]
----
<1> The protobuf syntax version, `proto3`.
<2> The package name, `customer.view`.
<3> The Java outer classname, `CustomerViewModel`. Messages defined in this file will be generated as inner classes, for example `CustomerViewModel.ByEmailRequest`.
<4> Import the proto files for your domain model `customer/domain/customer_domain.proto` and Akka Serverless annotations `akkaserverless/annotations.proto`.

. Add the service endpoint
+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.src/main/proto/customer/view/customer_view.proto
----
include::example$java-customer-registry-views-quickstart/src/main/proto/customer/view/customer_view.proto[tag=CustomerByEmail]
----
<1> The Protobuf `service` for the View.
<2> The option that the Maven plugin will use to generate the `CustomerByEmail` View.
<3> The `UpdateCustomer` method defines how Akka Serverless will update the view.
<4> The source of the View is the `"customers"` Value Entity. This identifier is defined in the `entity_type: "customers"` property of the `(akkaserverless.codegen).value_entity` option in the `customer_api.proto` file.
<5> The `(akkaserverless.method).view.update` annotation defines that this method is used for updating the View. You must define the `table` attribute for the table to be used in the query. Pick any name and use it in the query `SELECT` statement.
<6> The `GetCustomers` method defines the query to retrieve a customer by email.
<7> The `(akkaserverless.method).view.query` annotation defines that this method is used as a query of the View.
+
NOTE: In this sample we use the internal `domain.CustomerState` as the state of the view. This is convenient since it allows automatic updates of the view without any logic but has the draw back that it implicitly makes the `domain.CustomerState` type a part of the public service API. Transforming the state to another type than the incoming update will be illustrated in the `CustomerByName` example.

. Run `mvn compile` from the project root directory to generate source classes from the Protobuf definitions.
+
----
mvn compile
----
+
This will result in a compilation error in the `Main` class. That is expected because you added a new component. Fix the compilation error by adding `CustomerByEmailView::new` as the second parameter to `AkkaServerlessFactory.withComponents` in `src/main/java/customer/Main.java`.

[#deploy]
== Package and deploy your service

To build and publish the container image and then deploy the service, follow these steps:

. If you haven't done so yet, sign in to your Akka Serverless account. If this is your first time using Akka Serverless, this will let you register an account, https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/projects/create-project.html[create your first project], and set this project as the default.
+
----
akkasls auth login
----

. Use the `deploy` target to build the container image, publish it to the container registry as configured in the `pom.xml` file, and then automatically https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/services/deploy-service.html#_deploy[deploy the service] to Akka Serverless using `akkasls`:
+
----
mvn deploy
----

. You can https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/services/deploy-service.html#_verify_service_status[verify the status of the deployed service] using:
+
----
akkasls service list
----

[#invoke]
== Invoke your service

Once the service has started successfully, you can https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/services/invoke-service.html#_testing_and_development[start a proxy locally] to access the service:

----
akkasls service proxy <service name> --grpcui
----

The `--grpcui` option also starts and opens a https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/services/invoke-service.html#_using_the_built_in_graphical_client[gRPC web UI] for exploring and invoking the service (available at http://127.0.0.1:8080/ui/).

Or you can use command line gRPC or HTTP clients, such as `grpcurl` or `curl`, to invoke the service through the proxy at `localhost:8080`, using plaintext connections.

A customer can be created using the `Create` method on `CustomerService`, in the gRPC web UI, or with `grpcurl`:

----
grpcurl \
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "abc123",
    "email": "someone@example.com",
    "name": "Someone",
    "address": {
      "street": "123 Some Street",
      "city": "Somewhere"
    }
  }' \
  --plaintext localhost:8080 \
  customer.api.CustomerService/Create
----

The `GetCustomer` method can be used to retrieve this customer, in the gRPC web UI, or with `grpcurl`:

----
grpcurl \
  -d '{"customer_id": "abc123"}' \
  --plaintext localhost:8080 \
  customer.api.CustomerService/GetCustomer
----

The customer can also be found using the `GetCustomer` method on the `CustomerByEmail` view service, in the gRPC web UI, or with `grpcurl`:

----
grpcurl \
  -d '{"email": "someone@example.com"}' \
  --plaintext localhost:8080 \
  customer.view.CustomerByEmail/GetCustomer
----

You can https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/services/invoke-service.html#_exposing_services_to_the_internet[expose the service to the internet]. A generated hostname will be returned from the expose command:

----
akkasls service expose <service name>
----

== Define the CustomerByName View

. In the same `src/main/proto/customer/view/customer_view.proto` file add another View for finding customers by name.
+
Add the service endpoint
+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.src/main/proto/customer/view/customer_view.proto
----
include::example$java-customer-registry-views-quickstart/src/main/proto/customer/view/customer_view.proto[tag=CustomerByName]
----
<1> The `UpdateCustomer` method defines how Akka Serverless will update the view. In this case use a `CustomerViewState` that is different from the incoming `domain.CustomerState`.
<2> `transform_updates: true` defines that you want custom code in the `UpdateCustomer` method.
<3> The `GetCustomers` method defines the query to retrieve customers by name.

. Run `mvn compile` from the project root directory to generate source classes from the Protobuf definitions.
+
----
mvn compile
----
+
Again, this will result in a compilation error in the `Main` class. That is expected because you added a new component. Fix the compilation error by adding `CustomerByNameView::new` as the third parameter to `AkkaServerlessFactory.withComponents` in `src/main/java/customer/Main.java`.

== Implement UpdateCustomer

. Implement the `emptyState` and `updateCustomer` method in `CustomerByEmailView`:
+
[source, java, indent=0]
.src/main/java/customer/view/CustomerByEmailView.java
----
include::example$java-customer-registry-views-quickstart/src/main/java/customer/view/CustomerByNameView.java[tag=view]
----
<1> Empty state that will be used if no previous state has been stored for the View.
<2> From the incoming `CustomerDomain.CustomerState` that represents the change from the Value Entity create a `CustomerViewModel.CustomerViewState`.
<3> Return `effects().updateState` with the new state for the View.
+
NOTE: The state of the View is still per Entity. The `CustomerDomain.CustomerState customerState` parameter represents the changed state of a specific Value Entity. The `state` parameter is the existing state, if any, of the View for the Entity, i.e. the state that was previously returned via `effects().updateState`. If no previous state has been stored the `emptyState()` is used.

== Deploy the updated service

. Deploy the updated service by repeating the steps in <<deploy>>.

== Invoke the CustomerByName

. Similar to the steps in <<invoke>>
. Create several customers with same name
. Use the new `CustomerByName` instead of `CustomerByEmail` and then you should see multiple results from `CustomerByName/GetCustomers` for customers with the same name

== Next steps
