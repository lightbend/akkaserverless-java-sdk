= Quickstart: Customer Registry with Kafka in Java

include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]
include::java:partial$attributes.adoc[]


Create a customer registry that includes publishing to Kafka. Package it into a container, and run it on Kalix.

== In this Quickstart you will learn:

* How to add additional functionality, allowing to publish customer's events to Kafka.
* How to package the customer registry into a container.
* How to deploy and run the customer registry on Kalix.

== Before you begin

* If you're new to Kalix, {console}[create an account, window="console"] so you can try out Kalix for free.
* You'll also need to install the https://docs.kalix.io/kalix/install-kalix.html[Kalix CLI, window="new-doc"] to deploy from a terminal window.
* For this quickstart, you'll also need
** https://docs.docker.com/engine/install[Docker {minimum_docker_version} or higher, window="new"]
** Java {java-version} or higher
** https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.x or higher, window="new"]
** https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl#installation[`grpcurl`, window="new"]
** Configure your project message broker to use Kafka and create the topic `customer_changes` by following the https://docs.kalix.io/projects/message-brokers.html[Configure message brokers] how-to. When setting the broker the configuration file you pass should be like `kafka/my-dev.kafka.properties` that you can find in this project.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to bypass writing code and jump straight to the deployment:

. Download the source code using the Kalix CLI:
`kalix quickstart download customer-registry-kafka-java`

. Skip to <<Package and deploy your service>>.
====

== Start from the Customer Registry Entity

Start by downloading the  xref:java:quickstart/cr-value-entity-java.adoc[Customer Registry Quickstart] source code using the Kalix CLI:

[source,command line]
----
kalix quickstart download customer-registry-java
----

In this guide, we will describe how to subscribe to events from the entity and forward them to a Kafka Broker. How to do this with an  https://docs.kalix.io/reference/glossary.html#action[Action]. Publishing an event each time a customer is created or updated

== Define an Action

The `customer_action.proto` will contain the definition of this action.

. In your project, create a directory for your protobuf file, `src/main/proto/customer/action`.
[.tabset]
Linux or macOS::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
mkdir -p ./src/main/proto/customer/action
----
--
Windows 10+::
+
--
[source,command line]
----
mkdir src/main/proto/customer/action
----
--

. Create a `customer_action.proto` file and save it in the `src/main/proto/customer/action` directory.

. Add declarations for:
+
* The protobuf syntax version, `proto3`.
* The package name, `customer.action`.
* The required Java outer classname, `CustomerAction`. Messages defined in this file will be generated as inner classes.
* Import `customer/api/customer_api.proto`,`customer/domain/customer_domain.proto`, and Kalix `kalix/annotations.proto`.
+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.src/main/proto/customer/action/customer_action.proto
----
include::example$java-customer-registry-kafka-quickstart/src/main/proto/customer/action/customer_action.proto[tag=declarations]
----

. Add the service definition. The service definition is annotated with `kalix.codegen` indicating we want to generate an Action for this service.
. Add declarations for:
+
* Listening to `customer.domain.CustomerState` events from the value entity `customer` by using the option `eventing.in`.
* Publishing to the Kafka topic `customer_changes` by using the option `eventing.out`.
+
[source,proto,indent=0]
.src/main/proto/customer/action/customer_action.proto
----
include::example$java-customer-registry-kafka-quickstart/src/main/proto/customer/action/customer_action.proto[tag=service]
----

. Run `mvn compile` from the project root directory to generate source classes in which you add business logic.
+
----
mvn compile
----

== Create an Action

Actions are stateless functions that can be triggered in multiple ways. In this case, the action is triggered by each value change `customer.domain.CustomerState` received by the Value Entity `customer.domain.Customer`.

. If it's not open already, open `src/main/java/customer/action/CustomerStateSubscriptionAction.java` for editing.

. Modify the `onStateChange` method by adding the logic to handle the action. The complete method should include the following:
+
[source, java]
.src/main/java/customer/action/CustomerStateSubscriptionAction.java
----
include::example$java-customer-registry-kafka-quickstart/src/main/java/customer/action/CustomerStateSubscriptionAction.java[tag=upsert]
----
+
* The incoming message contains the updated state of the customer entity and this action converts it to a `CustomerApi.Customer` and passes it to the xref:java:actions-publishing-subscribing.adoc[Pub/Sub] mechanism of choice. In this example Kafka.

== Package and deploy your service

To build and publish the container image and then deploy the service, follow these steps:

. If you haven't done so yet, sign in to your Kalix account. If this is your first time using Kalix, this will let you register an account, https://docs.kalix.io/projects/create-project.html[create your first project], and set this project as the default.
+
----
kalix auth login
----

. Use the `deploy` target to build the container image, publish it to the container registry as configured in the `pom.xml` file, and then automatically https://docs.kalix.io/services/deploy-service.html#_deploy[deploy the service] to Kalix using `kalix`:
+
----
mvn deploy
----

. You can https://docs.kalix.io/services/deploy-service.html#_verify_service_status[verify the status of the deployed service] using:
+
----
kalix service list
----

== Invoke your service

Now that you have deployed your service, the next step is to invoke it using gRPCurl

. From the "_Service Explorer_" click on the method you want to invoke
. Click on "_gRPCurl_"
. In the bottom section of the dialog, fill in the values you want to send to your service
. In the top section of the dialog, click the "_Copy to clipboard_" button
. Open a new command line and paste the content you just copied
. Check the change made to the Customer appears in the topic `customer_changes` in the Kafka cluster on your Confluent Cloud.

== Next steps

* You can learn more about Value Entities in the xref:java:value-entity.adoc[reference documentation].
* Continue this example by xref:java:quickstart/cr-value-entity-views-java.adoc[adding Views], which makes it possible to query the customer registry.
