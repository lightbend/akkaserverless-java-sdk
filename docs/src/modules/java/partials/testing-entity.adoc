There are two ways to test an Entity:

* Unit tests, which run the Entity class in the same JVM as the test code itself with the help of a test kit.
* Integration tests, with the service deployed in a docker container running the entire service and the test interacting with it over HTTP requests.

Each way has its benefits, unit tests are faster and provide more immediate feedback about success or failure but can only test a single entity at a time and in isolation. Integration tests, on the other hand, are more realistic and allow many entities to interact with other components inside and outside the service. For example, actually publishing to a pub/sub topic.
