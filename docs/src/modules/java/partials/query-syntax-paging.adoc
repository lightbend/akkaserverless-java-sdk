=== Paging

Splitting a query result into one "page" at a time rather than returning the entire result at once is possible in two ways:

* with a count based offset or
* a token based offset.

In both cases `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` are used.

`OFFSET` specifies at which offset in the result to start

`LIMIT` specifies a maximum number of results to return

==== Count based offset ====

The values can either be static, defined up front in the query:

[source,proto,indent=0]
----
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10
----

Or come from fields in the request message:
[source,proto,indent=0]
----
SELECT * FROM customers OFFSET :start_from LIMIT :max_customers
----

Note: Using numeric offsets can lead to missing or duplicated entries in the result if entries are added to or removed from the view between requests for the pages.

==== Token based offset ====

The count based offset requires that you keep track of how far you got by adding the page size to the offset for each query.

An alternative to this is to use a string token emitted by Kalix identifying how far into the result set the paging has reached using the functions `next_page_token()` and `page_token_offset()`.

When reading the first page, an empty token is provided to `page_token_offset`. For each returned result page a new token that can be used to read the next page is returned by `next_page_token()`, once the last page has been read, an empty token is returned (see also xref:has-more[has_more] for determining if the last page was reached).

The size of each page can optionally be specified using `LIMIT`, if it is not present a default page size of 100 is used.

// end::spring[]
With a request and response message for the view like this:

[source,proto,indent=0]
----
message Request {
    string page_token = 1;
}

message Response {
    repeated Customer customers = 1;
    string next_page_token = 2;
}
----
// end::grpc[]
// tag::spring[]
With the query return type like this:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
public record Response(List<Customer> customers, string next_page_token) { }
----
// tag::grpc[]

A query such as the one below will allow for reading through the view in pages, each containing 10 customers:
[source,proto,indent=0]
----
SELECT * AS customers, next_page_token() AS next_page_token
FROM customers
OFFSET page_token_offset(:page_token)
LIMIT 10
----

The token value is not meant to be parseable into any meaningful information other than being a token for reading the next page.

==== Total count of results

To get the total number of results that will be returned over all pages, use `COUNT(*)` in a query that projects its results into a field. The total count will be returned in the aliased field (using `AS`) or otherwise into a field named `count`.

----
SELECT * AS customers, COUNT(*) AS total, has_more() AS more FROM customers LIMIT 10
----

[#has-more]
==== Check if there are more pages ====

To check if there are more pages left, you can use the function `has_more()` providing a boolean value for the result. This works both for the count and token based offset paging, and also when only using `LIMIT` without any `OFFSET`:

[source,proto,indent=0]
----
SELECT * AS customers, has_more() AS more_customers FROM customers LIMIT 10
----

This query will return `more_customers = true` when the view contains more than 10 customers.
