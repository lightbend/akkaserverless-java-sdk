IMPORTANT: If you time stamp your image. For example, `<dockerTag>${project.version}-${build.timestamp}</dockerTag>` you must always run both targets in one pass, i.e. `mvn deploy kalix:deploy`. You cannot run `mvn deploy` first and then `mvn kalix:deploy` because they will have different timestamps and thus different `dockerTag`s. This makes it impossible to reference the image in the repository from the second target.
