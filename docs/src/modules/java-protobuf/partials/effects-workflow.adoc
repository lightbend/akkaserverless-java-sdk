== Workflow's Effect API

The Workflow's Effect defines the operations that Kalix should perform when an incoming command is handled by a Workflow.

A Workflow Effect can either:

* update the state of the workflow
* define the next step to be executed (transition)
* pause the workflow
* end the workflow
* fail the step or reject a command by returning an error
* reply to incoming commands
