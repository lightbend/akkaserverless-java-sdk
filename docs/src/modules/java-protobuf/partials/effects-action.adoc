== Action's Effect API

The Action's Effect defines the operations that Kalix should perform when an incoming message is handled by an Action.

An Action Effect can either:

* reply with a message to the caller
* reply with a message to be published to a topic (in case the method is a publisher)
* forward the message to another component
* return an error
* ignore the call
