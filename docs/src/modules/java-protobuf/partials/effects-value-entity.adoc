== Value Entity's Effect API

The Value Entity's Effect defines the operations that Kalix should perform when an incoming command is handled by a Value Entity.

A Value Entity Effect can either:

* update the entity state and send a reply to the caller
* directly reply to the caller if the command is not requesting any state change
* rejected the command by returning an error
* instruct Kalix to delete the entity
