== Event Sourced Entity's Effect API

The Event Sourced Entity's Effect defines the operations that Kalix should perform when an incoming command is handled by an Event Sourced Entity.

An Event Sourced Entity Effect can either:

* emit events and send a reply to the caller
* directly reply to the caller if the command is not requesting any state change
* rejected the command by returning an error
* instruct Kalix to delete the entity
