Actions are stateless functions that can be used to implement different uses cases, such as:

- a pure function.
- request conversion - you can use Actions to convert incoming data into a different format before forwarding a call to a different component.
- as a face or controller to fan out to multiple calls to different components.
- publish messages to a Topic.
- subscribe to events from an Event Sourced Entity.
- subscribe to state changes from a Value Entity.
- schedule and cancel Timers.

Actions can be triggered in multiple ways. For example, by:

- a gRPC service call.
- an HTTP service call.
- a forwarded call from another component.
- a scheduled call from a Timer.
- an incoming message from a Topic.
- an incoming event from an Event Sourced Entity, from within the same service or from a different service. 
- state changes notification from a Value Entity on the same service.
