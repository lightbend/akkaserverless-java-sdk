# This is script is used in CI to build scala-protobuf-eventsourced-customer-registry image.

# The CI script uses a matrix with a pre-cmd hook to run tasks before the tests.
# However, we can't pass more than one command in the pre-cmd hook. 
# To work it around, we pass a simple shell script with all the steps that we require for the pre-cmd hook.

# in CI we'll have a file kalix-sdk-version.txt at the home dir
