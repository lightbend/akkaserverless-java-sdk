# Customer Registry example (using a Value Entity)


## Building and running unit tests

To compile and test the code from the command line, use

```shell
sbt test
```



## Running Locally

In order to run your application locally, you must run the Kalix proxy. The included `docker compose` file contains the configuration required to run the proxy for a locally running application.
It also contains the configuration to start a local Google Pub/Sub emulator that the Kalix proxy will connect to.
To start the proxy, run the following command from this directory:

```
docker-compose up
```

To start the application locally, use the following command:

```
sbt run
```

For further details see [Running a service locally](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/developing/running-service-locally.html) in the documentation.

## Exercise the service

With both the proxy and your application running, any defined endpoints should be available at `http://localhost:9000`. In addition to the defined gRPC interface, each method has a corresponding HTTP endpoint. Unless configured otherwise (see [Transcoding HTTP](https://docs.akkaserverless.dev/java/writing-grpc-descriptors-protobuf.html#_transcoding_http)), this endpoint accepts POST requests at the path `/[package].[entity name]/[method]`. For example, using `curl`:

* Create a customer with:
  ```
  grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"customer_id": "wip", "email": "wip@example.com", "name": "Very Important", "address": {"street": "Road 1", "city": "The Capital"}}' localhost:9000  customer.api.CustomerService/Create
  ```
* Retrieve the customer:
  ```
  grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"customer_id": "wip"}' localhost:9000  customer.api.CustomerService/GetCustomer
  ```
* Query by name:
  ```
  grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"customer_name": "Very Important"}' localhost:9000 customer.view.CustomerByName/GetCustomers
  ```
* Change name:
  ```
  grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"customer_id": "wip", "new_name": "Most Important"}' localhost:9000 customer.api.CustomerService/ChangeName
  ```
* Change address:
  ```
  grpcurl --plaintext -d '{"customer_id": "wip", "new_address": {"street": "Street 1", "city": "The City"}}' localhost:9000 customer.api.CustomerService/ChangeAddress
  ```

## Deploying

To deploy your service, install the `akkasls` CLI as documented in
[Setting up a local development environment](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/setting-up/)
and configure a Docker Registry to upload your docker image to.

You will need to set the `docker.username` system property when starting sbt to be able to publish the image, for example `sbt -Ddocker.username=myuser docker:publish`. 

If you are publishing to a different registry than docker hub, you will also need to specify what registry using the system property `docker.registry`.

Refer to
[Configuring registries](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-serverless/projects/container-registries.html)
for more information on how to make your docker image available to Kalix.

Finally, you can use the [Kalix Console](https://console.akkaserverless.com)
to create a Kalix project and then deploy your service into it 
through the `akkasls` CLI or via the web interface.
