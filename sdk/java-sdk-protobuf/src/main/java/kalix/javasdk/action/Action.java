/**
 * Actions are stateless components that can be used to implement different uses cases, such as:
 *
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>a pure function.
 *   <li>request conversion - you can use Actions to convert incoming data into a different.
 *   format before forwarding a call to a different component.
 *   <li>as a face or controller to fan out to multiple calls to different components.
 *   <li>publish messages to a Topic.
 *   <li>subscribe to events from an Event Sourced Entity.
 *   <li>subscribe to state changes from a Value Entity.
 *   <li>schedule and cancel Timers.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Actions can be triggered in multiple ways. For example, by:
 *<ul>
 * <li>a gRPC service call.
 * <li>an HTTP service call.
 * <li>a forwarded call from another component.
 * <li>a scheduled call from a Timer.
 * <li>an incoming message from a Topic.
 * <li>an incoming event from an Event Sourced Entity, from within the same service or from a different service. 
 * <li>state changes notification from a Value Entity on the same service.
 *</ul>
 *
 * An Action method should return an {@link Effect} that describes what to do next.
