/**
 * Value Entities persist their state on every change. You can think of them as a Key-Value entity where
 * the key is the entity id and the value is the state of the entity.
 * <p>
 * Kalix Value Entities have nothing in common with the domain-driven design concept of Value Objects.
 * The Value in the name refers to the direct modification of the entity's state.
 *
 * When implementing a Value Entity, you first define what will be its internal state (your domain model),
 * and the commands it will handle (mutation requests).
 * <p>
 * Each command is handled by a command handler. Command handlers are methods returning an {@link Effect}.
 * When handling a command, you use the Effect API to:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>update the entity state and send a reply to the caller
 *   <li>directly reply to the caller if the command is not requesting any state change
 *   <li>rejected the command by returning an error
 *   <li>instruct Kalix to delete the entity
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <S> The type of the state for this entity. */
